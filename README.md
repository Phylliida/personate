**Things you can do with this library include:**
* Create a personification of the Zig programming language that answers questions about itself based off its English manual ... in Mongolian
* Resurrect Alan Turing and ask him about any of his published papers ... then teach him how to use custom Discord emojis
* Use a single @decorator to give your bot the ability to call a weather forecast API ... then parse the raw JSON data into natural language
* Make an asynchronous swarm that interprets the images you post ... and writes poetry inspired by them, in your style
* Create chatbots ... that make other chatbots
* And a lot, lot more.

- Currently the bottleneck is documentation, but I will have a library with demos up within the next week
